## Dependency Management

During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your go.mod file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port
Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. Use
`os.Getenv("PORT")` in your code when referring to the server port.

### Start Command
When deploying an application, Kinsta will automatically create a web process.
